Raul S's Unfinished Skeleton RPG(Class of 2017)
This is the RPG game that I worked on for the Spring Semester of the 2016-2017 school year. I was unable to finish it before leaving school, so I'm leaving the files here in the hopes that someone else can build upon it and/or complete the game. I planned for this game to be about a hero on a quest for something of value but, instead it turned into a game about a skeleton who accidently saves the world while looking for his TV remote.
