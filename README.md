Raul S's Unfinished Skeleton RPG(Class of 2017)

This is the RPG game that I worked on for the Spring Semester of the 2016-2017 school year. I was unable to finish it before leaving school, so I'm leaving the files here in the hopes that someone else can build upon it and/or complete the game. I planned for this game to be about a hero on a quest for something of value but, instead it turned into a game about a skeleton who accidently saves the world while looking for his TV remote.

I spent so much time on the look of this game that I was only able to implement some basic controls. The arrow keys control Skel's movement, and the spacebar would interact with items in the environment (read: the lever in the overworld). Walking over the exit of Skel's Cave from the inside will take the player to the Overworld, while walking over the cave from the outside will take them inside.
